## About
I am a graduate architecture student exploring the intersection of computation, IT, and design within architectural practice. 
I am currently pursuing a Master of Architecture and a Master of Science in Computational Design Practices.

My methodology emphasizes justifying design decisions through data-driven insights and discovering innovative ways to 
streamline or enhance complex, time-intensive tasks in the AEC industry. I would like to specialize in developing scripts and 
plugins that empower designers to work more efficiently and elevate the quality of design outcomes.

## Currently Working On
- Parametric zoning envelopes derived from NYC FAR regulations  
- Grasshopper + Python workflows for rule-based massing and spatial logic  
- **Material In-Site**, a guide to material choice through quantified procurement,
  sourcing, and cultural context  

## Selected Interests
- Computational and parametric design systems  
- Architectural envelopes and structural frameworks  
- Rule-based and data-driven design methodologies
